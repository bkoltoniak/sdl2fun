My attempt to learn OpenGL and C++ at once. Based on Jason L. McKesson's OpenGL tutorial, a copy of which can be found at https://paroj.github.io/gltut/index.html

Requirements to build:
- graphic card with OpenGl driver support
- [glew](https://glew.sourceforge.net/install.html)
- [sdl2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
